# Brainfuck Compiler

Brainfuck is a programming language that is deliberately difficult to understand and completely impractical.

I started writing this compiler as an exercise on [CodeWars](http://www.codewars.com). The performance optimizations were a lot of fun,
especially converting loops into direct computations. If you haven't written an optimizing compiler before,
I recommend [trying the exercise yourself](http://www.codewars.com/kata/my-smallest-code-interpreter-aka-brainf-star-star-k)
before looking at the code here.
